		 Windows binary distribution.



This package contains precompiled copies of the Windows DLL files for the 
Allegro library, to save you having to compile it yourself. This is not a 
complete distribution of Allegro, as it does not contain any of the 
documentation, example programs, headers, etc. You need to download the full 
source version, and then just unzip this package over the top of it.

To install, run the batch file msvcmake.bat, either from a command prompt or 
by double-clicking on it from the Windows explorer. This will hopefully be 
able to autodetect all the details of where to find your compiler, and will 
automatically compile the various support programs that come with Allegro.

At the end of the install process you will be asked whether to copy libs and 
headers into your compiler directories, and whether to install the DLL files 
into the Windows system directory. You should normally say yes here, but if 
you prefer, you can leave these files in the Allegro directory, and then 
specify the paths to them later on, when you come to compile your own 
programs using Allegro.

There are three versions of the DLL included in this zip:

   alleg40.dll is the normal optimised version
   alld40.dll is the debugging build, and should be used during development
   allp40.dll is a profiling build, for collecting performance info

For more general information about using Allegro, see the readme.txt and 
docs/build/msvc.txt files from the source distribution.
