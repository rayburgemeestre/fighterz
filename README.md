    * INSTALLATION
    ***************************************************************************

    Fighterz can be ran from its directory after unzipping, without further
    instalation.

    There is no single yet, just multiplayer.

    The mapmaker.exe is very beta, it works fine but loading an existing map
    will not load its static background graphics..
